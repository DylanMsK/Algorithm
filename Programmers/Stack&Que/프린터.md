### 풀이
```python
def solution(priorities, location):
    answer = 1
    length = len(priorities)-1
    
    while priorities:
        print(f'priorities: {priorities}, location: {location}, answer: {answer}')
        doc = priorities.pop(0)
        for i in priorities:
            if i > doc:
                if location == 0:
                    location = length
                else:
                    location -= 1
                priorities.append(doc)
                break
        else:
            if location == 0:
                break
            length -= 1
            location -= 1
            answer += 1
    return answer
