### 풀이
```python
def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    answer = 0
    going = []
    while 1:
        answer += 1
        for truck in going:
            truck[0] += 1
        if going and going[0][0] > bridge_length:
            truck = going.pop(0)
            weight += truck[1]

        if weight - truck_weights[0] >= 0:
            truck_weight = truck_weights.pop(0)
            weight -= truck_weight
            going.append([1, truck_weight])
        else:
            spend = bridge_length - going[0][0]
            answer += spend
            for truck in going:
                truck[0] += spend
        if not truck_weights:
            answer += bridge_length+1 - going[-1][0]
            break

    return answer
